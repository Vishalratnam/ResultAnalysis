# Result Analysis
 
A project which which uses a database to store university student details along with their results with a web interface which allows students and faculty to review their results and analysis using graphs and histograms. Uploaded pictures of validated documents below.

# User Requirements
__Result Analysis and Visualisation__
1)	College has many departments, each of which have many sections, that have wide range of courses every semester.
2)	In each semester there are two internal assessments and one external assessment and final result is made from these recorded marks. We keep record of all the scores of all courses provided by each department.
3)	All the results are stored after each exam in a table created for that assessment. So, each assessment has a table which has student details, section details, marks and average.
4)	Another table has the information of the courses under each faculty and the section they teach to.
5)	Using these tables, we do analysis on student performance, section averages and course difficulty.
6)	On the choice of the user, we graphically represent the analysis. Graphs for comparing individual scores of an exam with that of different sections. Plots for course pass percentage and GPA distribution.
7)	All users have to have an account. They have to login every time they intend to access the database. 
8)	Comparing student marks in each internals, class average across different sections, performance of students in a particular semester compared to previous exams and semesters, performance of a class under a certain faculty, comparing class performance with college performance etc.
9)	 We can also try to analyse the effect of internals on the external exams.
10)	Finally, we can visualise the class averages, subject wise marks in both the internals, subject marks and many other things using different types of graphs.
